# 🛠️ Utils Directory

## What's This?

This is our `utils` folder, where we keep all the cool TypeScript files that do the behind-the-scenes work. 🎩 No fancy UI stuff here, just the code that makes things tick!

## What's Inside?

- A bunch of `.ts` files, each with its own special magic.
- Everything's about doing stuff, like calculations, data fetching... you name it!

## How to Use

- Need a function? Grab it from here. 📥
- Added something new? Awesome, just drop a line here about what it does. ✏️

## Just a Heads Up

- Try to keep things simple and clean. 🧹
- No strict rules, but let's not make a mess. 🙈
- Testing? Cool if you do, no sweat if you don't. 🤷

Remember, this folder is like our utility belt – always evolving! Feel free to tweak this README as we go. 👍
